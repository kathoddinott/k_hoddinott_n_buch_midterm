	<h2>the greatest movie of all time</h2>
	<p>I am  Nitya and I think we should argue about which is the greatest movie of all time. everone has their favorite movie and their perspective on what is the best of all time. for me, the greatest movie of all time is FIGHT CLUB by CHUCK PALAHNIUK. Its simple really.</p>
	<p>Kat on the other hand feels that we should argue about our favorite colors. what is the fun in that? discussing colors is all about philosophy and what it tells you about someones personality.<br>colors reflect your personality? well thats what mirrors are for genius!
