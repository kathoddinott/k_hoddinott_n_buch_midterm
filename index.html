  <h1>Midterm Argument</h1>
	<h2>Movies</h2>
	<p>I am  Nitya and I think we should argue about which is the greatest movie of all time. everone has their favorite movie and their perspective on what is the best of all time. for me, the greatest movie of all time is FIGHT CLUB by CHUCK PALAHNIUK. Its simple really.</p>
	<p>Kat on the other hand feels that we should argue about our favorite colors. what is the fun in that? discussing colors is all about philosophy and what it tells you about someones personality.<br>colors reflect your personality? well thats what mirrors are for genius!

	<h2>Colours</h2>
	<p>We should argue about colours. Colours are ore more universal than movies and everybody has a favourite colour. Not everybody has a favourite movie, or even likes movies. Therefore, movies are not a good topic to argue over. There's a wide range of colours and mixes of colours to choose from. The most well known colours are</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Blue</li>
		<li>Red</li>
		<li>Yellow</li>
	</ul>
	<p>They are also know as primary colours. You can create any colour from mixing primary colours. Favourite colours can be as simple as a primary colour to as complex as a mixed colour like magenta. There is an endless array of colours to choose from which makes it a very interesting topic. Centainly more interesting than arguing about movies. Here's a picture of some wondful colours.</p>
